## What is your most significant technical achievement?

- First-author EMNLP 2025 paper on a test-time reinforcement learning agent that improves performance without labeled data or model weight updates. The system achieved 93.94% accuracy and reduced expert review workload by 85%, demonstrating scalable oversight and measurable safety improvement without retraining the base model.
- Co-authored Primus (arXiv:2502.11191, 2025), an open-source cybersecurity dataset suite for LLM pretraining and reasoning distillation, yielding a 15.9% aggregate benchmark improvement.
- Earlier in my career, I built and deployed an ML-based malware detection system (2016) powering safety-critical decisions at scale.

## Where can we find samples of your code?

Most production systems are enterprise and safety-critical and cannot be fully open-sourced.

Public artifacts:
- EMNLP 2025 + arXiv publications
- Primus open-source datasets (MIT / ODC-BY licensed)
- GitHub: https://github.com/sparktsao/ (LLM agent prototypes, evaluation experiments, red-team exploration)
